Description: Greatly reduces the amount of non-statistical work in conducting large data analysis projects using R and compiling reports containing many table and figures; specifically: 1) It provides a way to systematically record the outputs from the data analysis R script, even including format information if the output is a table. 2) It can automatically create a R markdown file to produce either 'MS Word', HTML, or PDF output. 3) Numeric columns of the tables in the report are formatted automatically and properly based on the distribution of the column.
